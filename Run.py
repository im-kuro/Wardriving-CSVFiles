--INFO
This is mainly a Wardriving script, meaning its meant to be able to be left un attened for up to as long as you need.
This script AUTOMATTICLY finds networks, deAuths them, and gets the CSV file to later brute force for access.

--LATER UPDATES
In future updates we intend to have a loaction pin point of some type to know where you where when you got the file
Along with more loggging to find more info about the area and what kind of network it was.

# airodump is used for getting close wifi networks
